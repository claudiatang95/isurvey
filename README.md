# AI-powered Follow-up Question Design in Structured Survey 

This study introduces an innovative approach to designing dynamic follow-up question in structured survey based on respondents’ input. To demonstrate the feasibility of this concept, a multi-agent workflow was designed and a demo application was developed with ChatGPT-4o model and Python streamlit framework. This approach aims to enhance the depth of data collection by generating tailored follow-up questions, particularly for respondents selecting the “Other” option, allowing for more flexible and richer survey responses.
